# web-scrapping

# The project aims to design a web scraping program for the users who intend to find a load of companies with google or bing search engine. The program can scrap search results from either google or bing between page n and page m where n and m can be assigned by the user. Google/bing results are filtered based on the attributes of their URLs to find the company homepages. The contact info is found by scraping the text on the company homepage. Titles of google results, company homepages, and contact info will finally be appended in three respective columns and saved as a CSV file.


# The picture below shows what the CSV file looks like:
